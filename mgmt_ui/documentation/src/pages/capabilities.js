      <h2>Capabilities and Benefits</h2>
      <p>Datamotive Workload Mobility provides the following key capabilities:</p>
      <p><b>Hybrid, Multi Cloud Simplicity</b> – Provides comprehensive SaaS simplicity across on-demand Disaster
        Recovery,
        Migration and Ransomware Recovery.</p>
      <p><b>Agentless Model</b> – Datamotive requires no agents on the protected VMs, leading to significantly simpler
        management of VMs under normal circumstances. Minimal performance impact on the protected VMs as compared to
        agent-based solutions and most importantly, no need to open additional (or per protected VM) ports in your
        firewall. Follow your Zero Trust Security policies completely.</p>
      <p><b>Industry Best SLAs</b> – Datamotive provides a 10 minutes or less RTO or CTO regardless of the size of the
        workload. If your VMs/workloads are 100 GB or 2 TB, Datamotive will always take 10 minutes or less to completely
        recover them in the cloud.</p>
      <p><b>Cost Optimized</b> – Reduce your capex and opex significantly by leveraging the economics and pay-per-use
        model of
        public clouds. Only pay for cloud storage costs. Pay for compute and network only when a disaster strikes, and
        your workloads are recovered in the cloud.</p>
      <p><b>Unlimited Test Recovery</b> – Execute Test Recovery workflows in a network fenced environment to safely and
        securely test your replication consistency.</p>
      <p><b>Ransomware Recovery</b> – Protect your workloads from cybercrime attacks by keeping point-in-time copies in
        air-gapped, low cost public cloud storage. In the event of a attack, choose the latest copy and recover your
        workloads in the cloud in minutes.</p>
