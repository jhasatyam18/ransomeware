      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Datamotive Workload Mobility product suite delivers a disaster recovery and workload migration service and
        offers cloud economics to help keep your disaster recovery and migration costs under control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Datamotive Workload Mobility can be used to protect your vSphere virtual machines by replicating them
        periodically to the cloud and recovering them as needed to a target public cloud platform as a native cloud
        instance (E.g., protected virtual machine is recovered as a native AWS EC2 instance or a GCP Compute instance).
      </p>
      <p>The Datamotive Replication Engine replicates the entire protected VM over to the target platform. This includes
        the OS, the OS configuration, the registry entries, application and application data, everything inside the VM
        is replicated. The first replication iteration is a full copy of the VM from the source environment to the
        target cloud platform. Following iterations, only replicate the changed data from the previously successfully
        completed replication iterations. Datamotive does not require or need any agents to be deployed or installed on
        the protected VMs. Each VM is completely treated as a black box by Datamotive. As a result, the enterprises
        workloads (VMs) require no operational management, nor require any special security configurations. There is
        also minimal performance impact on the business applications.</p>
      <p>The Datamotive Replication Engine also enables near instantaneous recovery of the workloads in the target cloud
        platforms. When the workloads are recovered or migrated in the cloud, they are already in the native cloud
        platform (AWS EC2 instance or GCP Compute instance formats). No additional conversion or rehydration or seeding
        is required. Datamotive provides an unprecedented Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 10 minutes per protected
        virtual machine. Similarly provided, in the case of Migration, is a Cutover Time Objective (CTO) of 10 minutes
        per VM with zero data loss.</p>
      <p>The Datamotive platform currently provides and supports Disaster Recovery and Migration use-cases. Very soon,
        Datamotive will also be providing and supporting Ransomware Recovery and Rapid Dev/Test Deployments (Cloud
        Cloning) use-cases.</p>
