Management Server     provides user interface (UI), a CLI and RESTful APIs for the IT     administrators to perform Day0-DayN activities. The server also acts     as replication node. It is shipped as an OVA for VMware environment     &amp; cloud native machine image for AWS, GCP &amp; Azure environments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Datamotive Replication Node\u2013 a virtual appliance deployed in     protected or recovery site. It is used to execute the data     replication jobs. This node can be used to increase the overall     replication capacity of the solution based on the number of     protected VMs/instances. Maximum number of parallel replication jobs     (1 replication job per protected disk/volume) supported by each     node is defined by the limit provided by Cloud platforms (AWS: 20,     GCP: 128). It is shipped as an OVA for VMware environment &amp;     cloud native machine image for AWS, GCP &amp; Azure environment.     Datamotive solution scales horizontally using the Replication Nodes     for large environments where high numbers of workloads need to be     replicated in parallel.</p> </li> <li> <p>Datamotive Prep Node \u2013 a Windows virtual appliance deployed in     the recovery site infrastructure (VMware, AWS, GCP or Azure).

This is a snapshot for how different nodes in Datamotive are working together.</p> <p></p> <p>Nodes Configuration</p> <p>Nodes are entities where the Datamotive server is installed (Ex. AWS, GCP, VMWare, Azure, etc.). Datamotive Nodes are of different types like Management, Replication, Dedup &amp; Win Prep. Each node has specific functionality.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Management: Node for performing Datamotive management operations.     There must be one and only Management node for each site (vCenter     Server for VMware &amp; a Region/Zone in Cloud). Management also has a     replication engine which allows it to double up as replication node     too.</p> </li> <li> <p>Replication: Nodes responsible for performing replication     activities. These can be added based on number of Virtual Machine     disks to be replicated in parallel. Any number of nodes can be added     to meet the requirement for large scale environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dedup: This is a special type of node required to support     deduplication. This node is required only on the Recovery site.</p> </li> <li> <p>Win Prep: This is also a special type of node required only on     Recovery site to perform Windows workloads recovery.</p> </li> </ol> <p>For all the nodes, Datamotive provides separate OVAs &amp; cloud specific machine images. Once Node of given type is deployed in the infrastructure, it needs to be added in the Datamotive Management server. Nodes must be deployed and configured in the following manner-</p> <ol> <li> <p>Management Node: Deploy 1 management node per protected site. The     local node representing the management node automatically gets     registered.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remote Management Node: Deploy 1 management node per recovery site.     Register the management nodes from Recovery Sites in Management Node     of Protected Site.</p> </li> <li> <p>Replication Nodes: Deploy replication node based on load. Once     deployed register replication node in the local management server.     Replication nodes are always added to local management node only.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Currently, Datamotive supports replication of 20 virtual disks per replication node.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Dedup Node: Deploy the Dedup node on Recovery Site. Once deployed,     register the Dedup node with Management Node on the Recovery Site.</p> </li> <li> <p>Win Prep Node: Deploy the Win Prep node on Recovery Site. Once     deployed, register the Win Prep node with Management Node on the     Recovery Site.</p> </li> </ol> <p>To Access Node option, Go to Configure -&gt; Nodes (Note- By default the Local node will be configured.)</p> <p>To add new node -</p> <p>Click On \u201c+ New\u201d option as shown below \u2013</p> <p></p> <p>It consists of the below options-</p> Name Name to identify the node.

The scripts are supported for individual VM, and complete protection plan as well. The scripts are available as both, pre and post hooks. To use pre or postscripts, upload the pre &amp; postscripts to Datamotive management node on both protected &amp; recovery sites using scripts section in settings or that can be uploaded from the upload new script section in the replication section. Once the scripts are uploaded, they will be visible in the pre and post replication scripts option. Datamotive currently supports Python 3.x, Golang &amp; Shell executable scripts. All the scripts must be in the form of executables to work. E.g., they should get executed as./\\&lt;script_file_name&gt;. Scripts are supported at the following levels. The scripts are also executed in the below order during replication &amp; recovery operations.</p> Script Type Execution Level Script Description Replication Protection Plan Pre-Script Executed in each replication iteration as a first step. Virtual Machine Pre-Script Executed in each replication iteration before every virtual machine\u2019s snapshot is taken Virtual Machine Post-Script Executed in each replication iteration after virtual machine\u2019s snapshot is completed Protection Plan Post-Script Executed in each replication iteration after all the virtual machine\u2019s snapshot operation is completed Recovery Protection Plan Pre-Script Executed during Test/Full Recovery &amp; Migration operations as a first step Virtual Machine Pre-Script Executed before starting recovery of every virtual machine Virtual Machine Post-Script Executed after every virtual machine is recovered Protection Plan Post-Script Executed after completion of recovery operation for all virtual machines. <p>Following screens show options where user can select/upload various scripts-</p> <p></p> <p>Scripts Input</p> <p>Currently, Datamotive supports only binary for execution. The runtime available for scripts is Shell, Bash, Python 3.x &amp; Golang. In future, support for different languages will be provided. On invocation of the recovery scripts, Datamotive provides the following parameters in the order.</p> <p>Pre-script: \\&lt;None&gt;</p> <p>Post-script: JSON string with following format</p> <p>{</p> <p>[</p> <p>{</p> <p>\u201cName\u201d: \\&lt;VM Name&gt;,</p> <p>\u201cSourceID\u201d: \\&lt;Platform ID of source VM&gt;,</p> <p>\u201cTargetID\u201d:\\&lt;Platform ID of recovered VM&gt;,</p> <p>\u201cNetworkInfo\u201d: [{</p> <p>\u201cPublicIP\u201d: \\&lt;Public IP if assigned to recovered VM&gt;,</p> <p>\u201cPrivateIP\u201d: \\&lt;Private IP if assigned to recovered VM&gt;</p> <p>}],</p> <p>\u201cCredentials\u201d: {</p> <p>\u201cUsername\u201d: \\&lt;Login username of the recovered VM&gt;,</p> <p>\u201cPassword\u201d: \\&lt;Login password of the recovered VM&gt;</p> <p>}</p> <p>}</p> <p>]</p> <p>}</p> <p>Scripts Output</p> <p>The scripts are checked for its completion and the process exit status is captured. If there are no errors in executing the script, Datamotive considers it to be successfully executed. If there are errors, the recovery jobs for that particular vm or protection plan is marked as Partially Completed.</p> <p>Step 5: Boot Order</p> <p>Using boot order configuration defines the boot delay and virtual machine boot order.</p> <p>Boot Delay : Delay in seconds between virtual machines specified in the boot order.</p> <p>Boot Order : Order in which virtual machines will get recovered or migrated. Workloads with the least number will boot first.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 6: Replication Configuration</p> <p>Replication configuration allows user to specify the schedule for periodic replication of protected virtual machines. User can configure following parameters.</p> Start Time Time from when protection plan replication will start. Replication Interval Time interval in which the virtual machine\u2019s changed data will be replicated. Encryption on Wire Data encryption while transferring from source to destination. Compression Data compression while transferring from source to destination Dedup <p>Enables the data deduplication.</p> <p>**Note: Deduplication node should be pre-configured on recovery site before using this feature</p> Differential Reverse Replication Enable this feature if you want to allow recovered machines from the recovery site to replicate back to their original source site. Synchronize All VM Replication Enables all virtual machines in this protection plan to be replicated with similar sync time. Without this option a virtual machine will try to get scheduled at the configured PRO, irrespective of the virtual machine status <p> </p> <p>Note : This pertains to AWS as the target. If more than 100 virtual machines are replicated in parallel, replication may fail for snapshot creation due to AWS platform limitations (100 snapshots can be in a pending state across the account). Therefore, VM replications will be scheduled based on priority.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 7: Scripts</p> <p>As described in earlier scripts section, these are Replication &amp; Recovery scripts at Protection Plan level.</p> <p></p> <p>The runtime available for scripts is Shell, Bash, Python 3.x &amp; Golang. In future, support for different languages will be provided. On invocation of the recovery scripts, Datamotive provides the following parameters in the order.</p> <p>Pre-script: \\&lt;None&gt;</p> <p>Post-script: Post script gets 3 ordered parameters</p> <ol> <li>Recovered VM information: JSON string with following format</li> </ol> <p>{\"vms\":[</p> <p>{</p> <p>\"name\":\\&lt;VM Name&gt;,</p> <p>\"sourceID\":\\&lt;Platform ID of source VM&gt;,</p> <p>\"targetID\":\\&lt;Platform ID of target VM&gt;,</p> <p>\"ips\":[</p> <p>{\"publicIP\":\\&lt;Public IP if assigned&gt;, \"privateIP\":\\&lt;Private IP is assigned&gt;}</p> <p>],</p> <p>\"credentials\":{</p> <p>\"username\":\"\\&lt;Recovered VM logon username&gt;\", \"password\":\\&lt;Recovered VM logon password&gt;</p> <p>}</p> <p>}</p> <p>]</p> <p>}</p> <ol> <li> <p>User Inputs: As provided by user.</p> </li> <li> <p>Output of Recovery Pre-Script: JSON string with following format</p> </li> </ol> <p>{\"status\":\"\",\"code\":0,\"message\":\"\",\"data\":\"\"}</p> <p>Script timeout: This is the time in seconds at which the script would timeout. By default, it is 300 seconds and can be changed.</p> <p>Step 8: Summary</p> <p>Review the summary for the protection plan and click finish to configure the protection plan. On successful configuration, replication jobs will start for the virtual machines selected for this protection plan.</p> <p></p> <p>Protection Plan Actions</p> <p>Actions on a protection plan are available when a particular protection plan is clicked on and through the protection plan details page. Action will be enabled depending upon the context and state of the protection plan. Protection Plan actions also differ based on whether the plan is viewed on protected site or recovery site. Certain actions are available only at one site as shown below,</p> <p>Actions available through the protection plan details,</p> <p>Actions for source site Actions for recovery site</p> <p>Also during the recovery process, the job can be monitored as to which step the job is currently at </p> <p></p> <p>New: Click to configure new protection plan.</p> <p>Edit: Select protection plan from the list and click edit. Edit protection plan wizard will get open. In edit protection following operations were allowed</p> <ul> <li> <p>Add new virtual machine to plan.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove protected virtual machine from the plan. This action gets     completed on next successful iteration of the protection plan. Till     that time, the status for that VM shows as \u201cRemoving\u201d.</p> </li> <li> <p>Recovery configuration modification.</p> </li> <li> <p>Boot order configuration &amp; modification.</p> </li> <li> <p>Replication configuration</p> </li> <li> <p>Scripts modification.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Start: Start Replication for the selected protection plan when the protection plan is in stopped state.</p> <p>Stop: Stop the protection plan replication when the protection plan is in running state.</p> <p>Remove: To remove the protection plan, click on the Remove button and it will ask for confirmation. On confirmation, the protection plan will get deleted.</p> <p>**Note- Protection plan should be in stopped state with no running jobs.</p> <p>Recovery</p> <p>After the Protection Plans are configured and status for replications of virtual machines are in-sync, various recovery operations from the Datamotive Management Server on the recovery site can be used.</p> <p>To initiate recovery or migration go to \u201cConfiguration \u2014&gt; Protection Plan -&gt; Click on the protection plan on which recovery or migration operation need to perform.
